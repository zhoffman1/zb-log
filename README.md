# Book Logging App (name not final)
I've been really disliking Goodreads and its competitors recently so wanted to try my hand at making a book logging app.

My goal isn't to put this into production. I want to work on my web developments skills and work a bit more with React. Originally wanted to do this in Rust with Axum and Yew but found that to be a bit tedious in comparison to Flask and React. Hopefully I can use Rust in the future for something else, but for this project will probably stick with what I know (or at least what I am familiar with)

## Planned Features
- account creation
- log books read (date started, date finished)
- rate and review books
- search books by title and author (may or may not implement, we will see)
